#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


Software Engineering is the design, development, testing and maintaining of computer systems.
Software engineering is important in the technology industry as it enables automation, efficiency, precision and accuracy in relevant technological processes.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


1.STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING(1960s-1970s)
Structured programming emerged as a response to the complex and error-prone code that resulted from programming which is was done in an unstructured manner. It introduced the concept of breaking down programms into smaller, manageable functions or procedures. It emphasized control structures like loops, conditionals and subroutines making code easier to understand, maintain and debug.

2. THE WATERFALL MODEL(1970s)
The Waterfall Model was introduced by Winston W.Royce in 1970. It was one of the first formalized methodologies for software development. It outlined a sequential design provess where each phase flows into the next like a waterfall. The model emphasized thorough documentation and a clear understanding of requirements before proceeding to the next phase. It provided a structured approach to software development, which was particularly useful for large-scale projects. It set the stage for future methodologies by highlighting the need for a systematic approach to software engineering.

3. AGILE METHODOLOGIES (2000s)
Agile methodologies where introduced in 2001 by a group of software developers who advocated for a more flexible and collaborative approach to software development. Agile methodologies promote continuous feedback and iterative cycles that deliver small, functional pieces of software regularly. They revolutionazied software development by making the process more adaptable and responsive to change.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


1. Requirement analysis- involves gathering and analyzing the needs and requirements to create a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document that guides the entire project.

2. System design- Involves creating a sytem architecture dictated by the needs and requirements gathered in the Requirement analysis phase.

3. Implementation- Involves writing code based on the design phase. A functioning software product will be the result of this phase.

4. Testing- Involves checking the software for errors, ensuring it behaves as expected.

5. Deployment- Involves making the software available for use by making it run in a production environment.

6. Maintenance- Involves regular updates and fixes to the software over its lifespan.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


The Waterfall methodology involves a linear and sequential process with a fixed scope and extensive documentation that provides a rigid, well-documented approach that os suitable for projects with well-defined and stable requirements sych as governemnt or construction projects where changes are costly or impractical. Agile methodologies involve an iterative and incremental process where the project is divided into small, manageable chunks called sprints where each sprint delivers a potentially shippable product increment.It provides a flexible and adaptive approach with user feedback used to improve the software as requirements, needs and features are continuously updated. Agile methodologies are suitable for progects that need to deliver working software quickly or when working in an environment of continous integration and delivery, such as mobile app development and web development for startups.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


1. Software developer- they are the creators of the software and work closely woth other team members to ensure that the software meets the specified requirements and functions as intended. Responsibilities include: Developing the software by writing the code, implementing algorithms,data structires and user interfaces, identifying and fixing issues in the code

2. Quality Assurance (QA) engineer- they ensure that the software meets the quality standards and functions as expected. Responsibilities include: Developing detailed test plans and test cases vased on the software requirements and design documents , identify document and tracj defects in a bug-tracking system, suggest improvements to the testing process and overall software quality, including adopting new testing tools, methodologies or practices.

3. Project Manager- oversees the entire software development process. Responsibilities include: developing a detailed project plan that outlines the scope, timeline, budget and resources required for the project, manages the project budget and ensures that resources are used efficiently.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


Integrated Development Environments streamline the development process by integrating various tools into a single environment, allowing developers to write, test and debug code more efficiently.

Version Control Systems ensure that changes in the code are tracked, managed and merged correctly, enabling collaboration and safeguarding the codebase.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


1. Rapidly changing technology is a common challenge with new and better programming languages, frameworks and tools emerging regurlaly making it overwhelming to stay in the current. Strategies to navigate the constantly evolving technological landscape include: continuous learning to always up to date with new technologies, joining developer communities to stay informed about new trends and technologies.

2. Debugging and resolving issues can be time consuming and frustrating especially with complex issues that are difficult to reproduce. Strategies to overcome this challenge include: systematic debugging by isolating the issue, understanding the symptoms and testing hypotheses.

3. Changing requirements can disrupt the development process, leading to missed deadlines. This can be mitigated by using agile methodologies that are flexible and allow for iterative development.

4. Security vulnerabilities are a common challenge facing software engineer. Strategies to deal with them include using security best practices such as secure coding guidelines, regular security audits and encryption.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


1. Unit testing- involves testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation to ensure that each part works correctly. Importance; helps identify bugs early in the development process making it easier and less costly to fix them.

2. Integration testing- involves testing the interaction between the different components of the software. It helps identify interface issues such as incorrect data exchange, communication errors or mismatched interfaces.

3. System testing- involves testing the complete and integrated software application as a whole, It ensures that the software operates as a complete system with all components working together to achieve the intended outcomes.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts to effectively interact with AI models. Prompt engineering improves response quality; more clear and specific prompts lead to more accurate and relevant responses.
Effective prompt engineering enhances the user experience by tailoring the responses to fit the user's needs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: "Tell me about the solar system"
Improved prompt: "Explain the main characteristics of each planet in the solar system, including their size,composition and any notable features"

The improved prompt clearly specifies the focus on the planets and the required details about the planets. Specifying the details ensures that the response covers these key aspects for each planet. The improved prompt reduces the risk of irrelevant information.
